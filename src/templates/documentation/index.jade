It can be deployed in many ways, including Heroku, Docker, a public server, a local app for OS X and Linux â€” and even a server-less version well-suited to notebooks like Jupyter. It comes bundled with a core set of visualizations, but is built to support custom ones.

                                    | We've designed many ways to use Lightning, to support a variety of use cases. The options fall into three categories: use a prebuilt server, run your own server, or use locally without a server. Here we introduce the approaches; see individual sections below for more details.

                                p 
                                    | The prebuilt servers are the easiest way to get started with Lightning. You can use our public server  at [http://public.lightning-viz.org] to generate and share any of the core Lightning visualization types, or download the standalone app, which is perfect for doing local data analysis.

Just by installing the client you have access to Lightning's custom visualizations. This approach is great for data science applications, especially inside of notebooks, but has a few limitations. See the section on the Python client for more.
